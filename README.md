Kata is a simple automator for everyday note taking and journaling. It is a part of [Teamed with Kata](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atarity.teamed-with-kata) extension pack.

Each note entry will:
- be saved in `.md` file with name in date-name form like a `2018-06-13-todo.md`
- have an YAML meta data header. It contains "title" and "tags" sections with autocompletion and can be extended.
